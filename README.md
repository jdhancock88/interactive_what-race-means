##### About this project
Questions of Color is a video series published by The Dallas Morning News asking individuals within the community of differing races and ethnicity about their experiences with race and diversity. 

The series focused on seven questions, such as "Have you ever been followed in a store?" or "What is the first thing you do when you get pulled over?"
